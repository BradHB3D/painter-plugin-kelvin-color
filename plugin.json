    "description": "Brad's Kelvin Color Painter Plugin: This plugin allows the user to add a \"Kelvin Color to RGB\" reference dock to Painter UI. This dock displays an RGB color swatch, generated from a Temperture slider (Kelvin). These colors are particularly useful as emissive color reference. Color is a close approximation, and presets represent a general average. Actual colors vary greatly.
