Substance Painter Plugin: Kelvin Color

Brad's Kelvin Color Painter Plugin: This plugin allows the user to add a __Kelvin Color to RGB__ reference dock to Painter UI. This dock displays an RGB color swatch, generated from a Temperture slider (Kelvin). These colors are particularly useful as emissive color reference. Color is a close approximation, and presets represent a general average. Actual colors vary greatly. Credit to Tanner Helland's Kelvin to RGB algorithm, as this conversion is adapted from his work (http://www.tannerhelland.com/4435/convert-temperature-rgb-algorithm-code/). 

## Installation

Download or clone this project into the Substance Painter plugins folder: ``Documents\Allegorithmic\Substance Painter\plugins\Kelvin Color``. The plugins folder can be opened from Substance Painter through the menu ``Plugins/Plugins folder``. Substance Painter needs to be restarted for the plugin to take effect.
