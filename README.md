__Substance Painter Plugin: Kelvin Color__

![Alt text](Screenshot.png?raw=true "UI Screenshot")

Kelvin Color Painter Plugin: This plugin allows the user to add a __Kelvin Color to RGB__ reference dock to the Painter UI.

This dock displays an RGB color swatch, generated from a Temperture slider (Kelvin). These colors are particularly useful as emissive color reference. Color is a close approximation, and represent a general average. Actual colors vary greatly.
